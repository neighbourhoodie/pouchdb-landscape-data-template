# PouchDB

[Apache® PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) is the open-source, in-browser JavaScript database that lets you save data locally, so you can keep going regardless of network coverage.

It’s the sibling technology of [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), and pairs with it to save data locally and then sync when your device re-establishes internet connectivity.

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare workers in a place with patchy Internet:**: PouchDB gives high-fidelity access to your patients’ data well keeping it secure.
- **Field technicians repairing critical infrastructure:**: PouchDB keeps track of work orders and collects all field info, including photos.
- **First responders working in a disaster area**: PouchDB coordinates relief efforts on the ground without getting in the way.

## Key Advantages

- **Open, proven, well-specified replication**: Build with flexibility and confidence thanks to PouchDB and CouchDB’s refined, battle-hardened and publicly spec’d replication protocol.
- **Doesn't lose data on conflicts**: Enjoy full control over conflict resolution logic unlike last-write-wins, PouchDB won't lose any writes and is more flexible than CRDTs.
- **Bring your own architecture**: Build upon flexible date topology. Use PouchDB for P2P, client-server and multi-primary scenarios or as a local cache.
